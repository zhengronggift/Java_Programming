Project Submission:

To submit your project you will create a project folder with your name. Example
is karlweiss-project. Within that folder you will have the following folders:

java  -  contains all your source code.
class  - contains all your .class files.
resource - contains all your resource files (images, sounds, etc).
javadoc - contains all your javadoc files.
uml - contains your uml diagram(s).
storyboard - contains your final storyboard document.

The high level folder will be converted to a zip file and submitted.


Project Presentation:
Nov 26 - 9:30AM to 10:50AM in FL404 (Both in-class and on-line)
Dec 5 - 7:45AM to 10:15AM in FL404 (In-class students)
Dec 5 - 6:00PM to 9:00PM in GS103 (Online students)

If you want to present on Nov 26, please email me with that request. There
will only be around 12 people who can present. This is open to both in-class 
and online students. If the Dec 5 time slot that you are assigned to is an issue,
please email me and we will attempt to schedule you in the other presentation time slot.

Your project presentation should be no more than 5 minutes.
You should demonstrate all the required features of the project:
1) Menu Bar
2) New Game
3) Help
4) Persistent storage of game status.
You should also demonstrate how your game plays in some detail. For example,
in the Tic Tac Toe game, there should be a demonstration of a winning game and
a tie game.
Be prepared to answer questions on the design and implementation of your project.
You should also demonstrate features that have gone beyond the minimum requirements.
These will help your grade.

You are encouraged to bring your laptop, which you can connect through an htmi interface.
You can also use VMWare with the local computer system in the classroom.
